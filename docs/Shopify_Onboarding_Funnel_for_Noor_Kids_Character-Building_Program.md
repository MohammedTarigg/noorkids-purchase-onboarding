**Shopify Onboarding Funnel for Noor Kids' Character-Building Program** 

*Noor Kids* can increase conversions and customer lifetime value by using a **multi-page interactive onboarding funnel**. This quiz-style funnel will engage parents of 6–14 year-olds, personalize the 1   
experience, and lead them to a **$0.99 trial sign-up (then $89.99/year)** , with strategic upsells. Below is a comprehensive design plan, including step-by-step pages, content structure, examples from similar DTC brands, conversion tactics, and implementation suggestions. 

**Funnel Structure & Step Goals** 

**Recommended Funnel Steps (5–6 pages \+ upsells):** 

1\.    
**Welcome & Child Profile –** *Goal:* Introduce the experience and gather the child's basic info (age) for personalization.  

2\.    
**Behavior Challenges –** *Goal:* Ask which behaviors or pain points the parent is concerned about, to 

emotionally invest them and collect “pain point” data.  

3\.    
**Values to Instill –** *Goal:* Ask which character values the parent prioritizes (honesty, kindness, discipline, etc.), capturing their aspirations for the child.  

4\.    
**Personalized Insights –** *Goal:* Reflect back the parent’s answers with insights that **resonate** 

**emotionally**, validating their concerns and highlighting growth opportunities.  

5\.    
**Program Introduction –** *Goal:* Present Noor Kids’ Character-Building Program as the tailored 

solution, linking its value to the specific challenges/values mentioned.  

6\.    
**Trial Offer & Sign-Up –** *Goal:* Drive conversion by showcasing the $0.99 trial offer and its benefits, leading into checkout. *(Upsells will be presented during/after checkout.)* 

Following the sign-up, the **checkout flow** will include upsell offers: **(a)** a discounted *book bundle* of past Noor Kids titles, and **(b)** a *free 1-month trial* of the **Muslim Treehouse** digital library (auto-renewing monthly thereafter). These maximize immediate and long-term value. 

**Step-by-Step Page Content & Design** 

**Step 1: Welcome & Child Profile (Age Input)** 

•    
**Goal:** Warmly welcome the parent and collect the child's age to tailor the journey.  

•    
**Headline & Copy:** *“Let’s Personalize Your Child’s Journey”* – A friendly intro explaining that answering a 

few quick questions will help customize a program for *their* child. Reassure that it’s quick and fun (e.g., “\<5 minutes”).  

•    
**Question Prompt:** *"How old is your child?"* Use an age picker or buttons (6–14) for easy input.  

1  
•    
**Emotional Triggers:** Emphasize that *every child is unique*. A subtext might say, “We know a 6-year 

old’s needs differ from a 12-year-old’s – let’s get it right for your child.” This makes parents feel understood from the start.  

•    
**Visuals:** A heartwarming image of a parent and child or a fun illustration of kids of various ages. This creates a positive, trusting mood.  

•    
**Conversion Elements:** A visible **progress indicator** (e.g. “Step 1 of 5”) at the top to encourage 2   
completion – a clear progress bar *“helps motivate users to finish”* . Keep the **Next** button prominent. (No navigation links to avoid exit.) 

**Step 2: Behavior Challenges** 

•    
**Goal:** Identify the parenting challenges/pain points to both gather data and create emotional investment.  

•    
**Headline & Prompt:** *“Which of these challenges do you face with your child?”* – An empathetic prompt 

like “(Select any that apply)” with choices that **echo common pain points**. For example: **Disrespect/ Not listening**, **Lying or dishonesty**, **Lack of discipline/routine**, **Screen time or distractions**,  **Struggles with confidence**, **Other**.  

•    
**Input Format:** Use icon-based multiple-choice buttons or checkboxes. Each choice might have a small relatable graphic (e.g. a child on a device for “screen time” issue) to make it engaging.  

•    
**Emotional Triggers:** The copy should reassure **“you’re not alone.”** For instance, *“Many parents* 

*struggle with these. Which behavior worries you most?”* This validation builds trust. The act of selecting a concern implicitly makes the parent acknowledge the problem, preparing them to seek a solution   
3 

•    
.  

**Visuals:** Perhaps an illustration of a frustrated parent or a comic-style image of a child scenario corresponding to one of the challenges (kept light and not overly negative). This fosters empathy without overwhelming.  

•    
**UX Tips:** Keep this page simple – one question with a few options – so it doesn’t feel like a tedious survey. The **progress bar** advances (“Step 2 of 5”) to show momentum. 

**Step 3: Values to Instill** 

•    
**Goal:** Understand the positive values the parent wants to teach, capturing their aspirations and shifting focus to solutions.  

•    
**Headline & Prompt:** *“What values or qualities do you most want to instill in your child?”* – Frame it 

positively: “Choose up to 3.” Provide options like **Honesty**, **Kindness/Empathy**, **Discipline & self control**, **Respect**, **Confidence**, **Faith/Islamic knowledge**, etc. (These align with Noor Kids’ 4   
curriculum topics under *Akhlaq (character)*, etc. .)  

•    
**Input Format:** Multi-select buttons with friendly icons (e.g., a heart for kindness, hands praying for faith). This engages the parent visually in picking ideals.  

•    
**Emotional Triggers:** This step triggers hopeful feelings. It reminds parents of their **dream outcome** 

(a child who is honest, kind, and disciplined). For example, a subtext might read, *“Imagine \[Your Child\] growing up with these qualities – which matter most to you?”* This creates an emotional **vision of success**, increasing desire for a solution to achieve it.  

•    
**Visuals:** Uplifting imagery – perhaps happy children demonstrating good behavior (e.g., sharing, helping) – reinforcing the positive tone.  

•    
**Copy Tone:** Encourage with a line like, *“Great choice\! Focusing on values like these is key to building strong character.”* Little affirmations after selection can keep energy up. (The quiz app can show a brief confirmation before moving on.) 

2  
**Step 4: Personalized Insights Reflection** 

•    
**Goal:** Reflect the parent’s inputs back as a concise, **insightful narrative** that resonates emotionally and builds urgency for a solution. This is essentially the “quiz result” that transforms their mindset   
3 

•    
.  

**Title/Intro:** *"Your Parenting Insights"* or *"Your Child's Character Profile"*.  

•    
**Content:** In 2–3 short paragraphs, **acknowledge** and **validate** their situation:  

*Example:* **"At 8 years old, many children start testing boundaries – so it's understandable you're concerned about honesty and not listening. You mentioned wanting to nurture honesty and discipline in your child.** Great insight – it shows you're a proactive parent\! **At this age, building these values is crucial:** without guidance, small lies or habits now can become bigger issues later. But with the right approach, 8 is the perfect age to shape your child's character for the better."\* 

This kind of copy does a few things: it **plays back their concerns and goals**, making them feel *heard*; it provides a helpful nugget (e.g., a developmental fact or simply the reassurance that “this age is pivotal”); and it hints at consequences (soft pain point) vs. rewards (hope) – subtly raising stakes. The tone is empathetic and hopeful. Parents should feel “Yes, this is exactly my situation” and also “I need to do something about it.” (In essence, we’re **“shifting their emotional state”** from mere curiosity to recognizing 3   
a real need .)   
\- **Emotional Highlighting:** You might bold key phrases like *“crucial”*, *“without guidance”*, *“perfect age to shape”* – to drive urgency and optimism.   
\- **Personalization:** Dynamically insert the child’s age and the specific challenge/value words the parent chose (e.g., honesty, confidence) so the insight **feels uniquely tailored** to them. This personal touch increases trust and engagement. 

\- **Visuals:** A gentle illustration (maybe a “thought bubble” of a parent thinking about their child’s future, or a small infographic of “Age 8 is a key growth stage”). Keep it minimal here to focus on the message. \- **Call-to-Action:** Conclude this page’s text with a lead-in to the solution: *“So how can you effectively nurture honesty and discipline in a fun, age-appropriate way?”* – This rhetorical question sets up the next page. A **continue button** might say “See the Solution ➜” instead of “Next,” indicating they’re about to get an answer. 

*(Optionally, this step can capture the user’s email before proceeding: e.g., “Enter your email to get a copy of these 5*   
*insights and personalized tips.” Many brands ask for an email at this point to not lose the lead . You could allow skipping it, but capturing the email here ensures you can follow up even if they don’t convert immediately.)* 

**Step 5: Program Introduction & Value Proposition** 

•    
**Goal:** Introduce **Noor Kids’ Character-Building Program** as the **ideal solution**, highlighting features/benefits in context of the parent’s needs. This page educates and excites the parent about the program before the signup.  

•    
**Headline:** *"Meet the Character-Building Program – Built for \[Child's Age\]-Year-Olds"* or simply 

*“A Personalized Program to Raise a Confident, Kind Muslim”*. Make it solution-oriented and tied to their child (using the age/value info).  

•    
**Copy Structure:** Use an engaging mix of **headline \+ bullet points** or short sections. Key messaging: 3  
•    
**It’s Fun and Effective:** Emphasize that *learning Islam and character shouldn’t feel like homework\!* Noor Kids is *“an Islamic education program that kids actually enjoy”, designed with fun at its core . This*   
*6* 

*tackles the parent’s fear that their child might find religious learning boring or hard –* “No dry lectures, just engaging stories and activities.”\*  

•    
**Curriculum Built for Character:** Explain how the program covers the very values and behaviors they care about. For example: *“Each month, a new Noor Kids book focuses on important values – 4*   
*honesty, kindness, patience, etc. – through stories and activities . So if lying or disrespect has been an issue, you’ll love how our stories teach honesty and respect in a way kids understand.”* Tie at least one of the parent’s chosen values into this description (e.g., *“We specifically cover honesty and discipline in our curriculum”*). This **connects the program’s features to their needs**.  

•    
**Proven & Trusted:** Build credibility. Mention that the program was *“designed at Harvard”* and is  6 7   
*“backed by scholars, approved by parents, loved by kids”* . Also note the evidence-based framework – e.g., *“Our 36-topic curriculum is structured to nurture character (akhlaq), faith (aqeedah), 4*   
*and community awareness .”* Such specifics show it’s well-thought-out and comprehensive.  •    
**Tangible Benefits:** Paint a picture of outcomes: *“Imagine your child eagerly awaiting their new book each month, excited to share lessons of kindness they learned. Over the year, you’ll see them start to naturally incorporate Islamic values in daily life – no more constant nagging or worry.”* This future pacing lets the parent *feel* the relief and pride the program can bring.  

•    
**Ease and Consistency:** Highlight that it’s a **consistent monthly program** – *“A new book arrives every 8*   
*month for 12 months , creating a routine your child will love.”* This turns discipline into something anticipated. Add *“bite-sized lessons and discussion questions in each book help you as a parent reinforce the teachings without any heavy lifting”*. Essentially, reassure them that the program makes their parenting job easier.  

•    
**Social Proof:** Include a **testimonial** from a happy parent to drive the message home (possibly in a stylized quote or sidebar). For example: *““My kids have learned behavior skills and manners they would not have otherwise… The books teach the kids to engage with Allah and His Prophet along the way.” – 9*   
*Maria S., mom* or another review highlighting a child’s improved character. A relatable testimonial 5   
acts as powerful proof that *“this worked for me, it can work for you”* .  

•    
**Visuals:** This page should be visually engaging to showcase the product. Suggested images: a photo of a child reading a Noor Kids book, smiling (emotional appeal: child enjoyment), and/or a spread of sample pages or the monthly book collection. You might use an image of the *Noor Kids books* 10   
*themselves* or the *“Curriculum Wheel”* graphic if available (to illustrate the range of topics) . Ensure images are bright and invoke positive emotions (joy, faith, family bonding).  

**Call-to-Action:** After the value prop, present a clear CTA: *“Start Your 1-Month Trial for $0.99”*.   
•  

Emphasize it’s almost free – a **low-risk trial**. Under the button or as a subtext, clarify *“Continue for* 11   
*$89.99/year afterward, cancel anytime”* so they know the terms upfront (transparency builds trust). The button could say **“Start My 99¢ Trial”** or **“Join Now – Only $0.99”**. Alongside, you might display a small trust indicator (e.g., “952+ reviews” or star-rating graphic) to reinforce that many others have subscribed. Also, if available, include icons for “Secure Checkout” or a money-back guarantee if Noor 12   
Kids offers one (e.g., “Cancel anytime” is already a safety net ).  

**Urgency & Incentive:** If feasible, add a subtle urgency trigger like *“Limited-time trial offer”* or a   
•  

countdown (as they had for Black Friday). Even a phrase like *“Today only: trial for $0.99”* can prompt 13   
immediate action. (Noor Kids sometimes markets the 99¢ as a special .)  

4  
•    
**Progress Bar:** By now it should indicate *“Step 5 of 5”* or *“Last step”*. Seeing the finish line encourages 

them to act now.  

This page essentially converts the personalized insight into a **tailored sales pitch** for the program, using emotional drivers (love for child, fear of missing out on moral development, desire for ease) and rational details (curriculum specifics, price, trial terms) to compel action. 

**Step 6: Trial Signup & Checkout** 

•    
**Goal:** Provide a seamless path for the parent to finalize the sign-up for the trial.  

•    
**Process:** Once they hit the CTA (e.g., “Start My 99¢ Trial”), it should either add the trial subscription to 

cart and go to checkout, or go directly to a **checkout page** with the trial ready to purchase. Keeping friction low is key – ideally one click from this page to a pre-filled checkout.  

•    
**Checkout Page Optimization:** Use Shopify’s checkout customization (logo, colors, etc.) to maintain trust. The order summary should clearly show “$0.99 – 1-month trial of Noor Kids Character-Building 11   
Program” and the subscription terms (e.g., “renews at $89.99/year after 1 month” ). This way the parent isn’t confused. Also, remind them it’s risk-free: *“(Cancel anytime in first month if it’s not for you.)”* Such reassurance can reduce cart abandonment.  

•    
**Upsell Introduction: During or immediately after checkout**, the funnel will present two upsell offers to boost value (details below). It’s important these offers are shown **after** the user has committed to the trial (or at least after clicking the sign-up CTA) so that the initial conversion isn’t distracted. Many brands successfully use one-click post-checkout offers for this reason, as it doesn’t 14   
interrupt the first purchase . 

**Checkout Upsell Offers for Higher AOV & LTV** 

Once the parent proceeds with the 99¢ trial, leverage that buying momentum by presenting **upsells** in the checkout flow. These should feel like **helpful additions** to enhance their experience, not pushy sales. Here’s how to structure them: 

**Upsell 1: Older Books Bundle (One-Time Offer)** 

\- **What:** A curated bundle of *past Noor Kids books* (e.g., 4–6 of the best previous issues or a “Starter Library” pack). Offer it at a special price **only available with the trial** (for example, “Add 4 classic Noor Kids books for $19 (50% off)” – adjust pricing as suitable). 

\- **Why:** This immediately increases the average order value by selling additional products. For the parent, it’s positioned as accelerating their child’s benefit: *“Get extra stories now to jump-start your child’s learning while you wait for the first monthly book\!”*. It appeals to eager parents who, after the emotional funnel, might want more content right away. 

\- **How:** After the user submits their trial order info (or on the final checkout step), show a page or pop-up: *“Wait\! Special Offer for New Subscribers ��”*. Highlight what’s included (book titles or topics) and use imagery (a spread of the books). Use an **emotional angle**: *“Since you care about nurturing \[honesty, kindness, etc.\], this bundle will give you even more stories and lessons to enjoy with your child immediately.”* It makes them feel it’s a natural extension of their purchase.   
\- **CTA:** A one-click “**Yes, add this bundle**” button that adds the bundle to their order (or charges it post purchase). Also have a subtle “No, thanks” link. One-click implementation means they **don’t re-enter** 

5  
**payment** – it’s frictionless. This is doable with Shopify’s post-purchase upsell features (apps can charge the 14   
card on file with one click) . 

\- **UX:** Make it clear this is optional. Use a countdown or note “This one-time offer is only for new members now” to nudge urgency. According to upsell platform data, well-timed post-purchase offers can boost AOV by **up to 30%** on Shopify stores . Even a fraction of users taking the bundle will significantly increase   
15 

revenue per customer. 

**Upsell 2: Muslim Treehouse Free Trial (Subscription Add-on)**   
\- **What:** A **free 1-month trial** to *The Muslim Treehouse* digital library (with automatic monthly renewal thereafter at the standard rate, e.g., $X/month). The Treehouse offers weekly online classes or a trove of digital content for kids (a perfect complement to the physical books). 

\- **Why:** This upsell aims at boosting **customer lifetime value (LTV)** by introducing the parent to another subscription. If they enjoy the free month, they’ll likely continue paying monthly, adding recurring revenue. It also deepens engagement with the brand’s ecosystem (books \+ digital content). 

\- **How:** Present this **after Upsell 1** (or if they declined Upsell 1, you can still show Upsell 2). For instance, *“�� Join Muslim Treehouse – Free for 1 Month”*. Explain in one sentence: *“Get access to weekly online classes and a digital library of Islamic content that keeps your child engaged all month long – FREE for the first 30 days.”* Emphasize it’s an easy add-on: *“After your free month, continue for just $X/month, cancel anytime.”* This framing makes it hard to say no, since it’s no upfront cost and clearly valuable.   
\- **Emotional Pitch:** Highlight how this complements the books: *“While our books arrive monthly, Treehouse gives your child something new to explore each week – from live storytime sessions to fun Islamic games – building on those values daily.”* This creates a feeling of *full support* for the parent’s goals. It also hints at *exclusivity* (maybe “members-only digital content”).   
\- **CTA:** “**Yes, give us Treehouse Free**” (one-click adds the Treehouse subscription to their account, not charging now). As before, include a small “No thanks” option. One successful example in DTC is *Spoiled Child*, a beauty brand that lets customers add an extra trial subscription with one click post-purchase – 14   
boosting retention and LTV . We mimic that here by making the Treehouse trial a one-click opt-in. \- **Note:** Ensure the checkout/app handles the subscription terms: the user should be shown or emailed that Treehouse will bill after the trial unless canceled. But the friction remains low because no new payment entry is needed, just one click.  

By offering these two upsells, Noor Kids can **maximize the immediate order value** (through the book bundle) and **increase long-term revenue** (through Treehouse subscriptions). Even if a fraction of users take them, it’s additional revenue with virtually no extra acquisition cost. Importantly, both upsells are highly relevant to the buyer’s interests (education and content for their child), making acceptance more likely. This relevance is key – it feels like a service, not a sell. 

*Execution tip:* Present upsells in a clean, uncluttered way. Do not overwhelm with too much text – a brief description, an image, and two choices (Yes or No) is ideal. Also, **do not remove the option to skip**; forcing an upsell can create frustration. The focus is on **value-add**. Many Shopify merchants use post-purchase 15   
upsell apps (like AfterSell or ReConvert) to create such one-click offers, reporting significant AOV lifts . 6  
**Conversion Optimization Tactics** 

To ensure this funnel performs well, we’ll apply proven **conversion rate optimization (CRO)** tactics: 

•    
**Progress Indicators:** As mentioned, use a visible progress bar or step count on all quiz pages. This   
gives users a sense of progression and reduces drop-offs by **motivating them to complete** .   
2 

Ensure it updates at each step (e.g., “Step 3 of 5”) and is especially obvious on mobile. A feeling of “almost there\!” can push users to finish the quiz and see the results. 

•    
**One-Question-Per-Page Design:** Keep each question step focused. This makes the user experience feel quick and not overwhelming (no long forms). It also allows you to craft each page’s copy and visuals around that single question, which maintains clarity. 

**Emotional Copy & Personalization:** Throughout the funnel, the copy should use **second-person** •    
**("you/your child")** to create a personal dialogue. The questions and reflections are **strategically crafted to shift the parent's emotional state** – from identifying problems to envisioning a solution – which is hallmark of high-converting quiz funnels 

3   
. We validate pain points (building trust), then stoke aspiration and relief by presenting the 

program. By the time the offer appears, the parent *feels* the need and is eager for the remedy only we provide. 

•    
**Social Proof & Testimonials:** Include **real customer testimonials and ratings** at critical junctures. For example, on the Program Introduction page and/or the Trial Offer page, show a brief review snippet or star-rating. Social proof reassures users that others have had success. The Little Company 5   
quiz example showed how inserting a testimonial in the results step reinforced trust . Noor Kids can do similarly: e.g., *“★★★★★ ‘It’s an amazing program – my daughter found a sense of Islamic* 16   
*community and improved her manners.’ – Yara A.”* . Authentic voices of other parents will address remaining doubts. 

•    
**Visual Engagement:** Use colorful, child-friendly design elements (in line with Noor Kids’ branding which features cartoon characters). Visual cues can guide the eyes (e.g., arrows or illustrations pointing to the Next button or the CTA). Ensure images used are optimized for fast loading (especially on mobile) – slow pages kill conversions. Also, avoid anything that looks too much like an ad; the design should feel native and story-like. 

•    
**Microcopy for Reassurance:** Pepper small notes to reduce friction: e.g., below the trial CTA, *“Cancel* 12   
*anytime. No commitment if you decide it’s not for you.”* This addresses the fear of being locked in. During checkout, show secure payment icons and perhaps *“Your information is safe with us.”* These little assurances can significantly improve completion rates for a purchase. 

**No External Links or Menu:** Treat the funnel pages as a **landing page sequence** – remove top •    
navigation or extra links that could distract or let users wander (except perhaps a small “Contact us” or privacy link in footer for credibility). Keep them focused on the quiz flow. 

•    
**Mobile-First Optimization:** Likely a majority of parents will go through this on mobile (from a Facebook or Instagram ad, for example). Make sure buttons are large enough, text is readable 

7  
without pinching, and images scale. Test the funnel on various devices. A smooth mobile UX (no need to zoom, no tiny checkboxes) will prevent drop-offs. 

•    
**A/B Testing Elements:** Over time, consider testing different emotional angles or question wordings. For instance, test a variation where the insight page emphasizes a *pain of not addressing the issue* vs. one that emphasizes the *positive outcome*. See which drives more conversions. Also test upsell take rates with different phrasing or bonuses (e.g., “50% off bundle” vs “extra 2 books free with bundle”). Constant iteration will optimize results. 

•    
**Follow-up if Abandoned:** If the user entered an email in the funnel (or reached checkout and   
provided email but didn't complete payment), set up an **abandoned-cart or follow-up email**. For example: *"You're so close to helping your child build great character\! Complete your 99¢ trial signup here"* with a link back. Use the data they provided – if you know they cared about honesty, mention *"Books that teach honesty and more are waiting."* This personalization in follow-up can recover potentially lost conversions. 

By implementing these tactics, the funnel not only guides the parent through a logical journey but also **appeals to their emotions, builds trust, and minimizes friction** at every step. The result should be a higher quiz completion rate and a higher trial sign-up rate than a generic product page, as well as a boost in immediate AOV (from upsells). 

**Inspiration from Successful DTC Funnels** 

Noor Kids wouldn’t be alone in using this kind of quiz-to-subscription model – many direct-to-consumer brands have thrived with similar strategies. Here are a few relevant benchmarks and examples: 

**Trade Coffee (DrinkTrade.com):** This coffee subscription brand’s entire sign-up is based on a   
•  

personalized quiz. New customers answer questions about their taste and brewing habits, and Trade recommends coffee matches and a subscription plan. This quiz-driven approach forms the 17   
foundation of their subscription service and demonstrates how tailoring the product to user preferences can improve conversion. Trade’s quiz educates the customer (similar to our “insights” step) and makes them confident in the subscription choice. 

•    
**Acabonac Pet:** A Shopify-based dog food subscription that uses a multi-step quiz to personalize meal plans. Notably, at the end of the quiz it shows a **custom plan result** and includes a **plug for** 18   
**add-ons (treats) with a checkout button for quick conversion** . This is analogous to Noor Kids offering a book bundle upsell. Acabonac’s success indicates that quiz takers are primed to add recommended extras. It’s a proof-point that a well-timed upsell in a funnel can boost AOV in a relevant way (treats for a dog, books for a child’s library in our case). 

•    
**Jones Road Beauty:** A makeup brand that launched a skincare quiz using Octane AI. Their quiz asks about skin concerns and routines, then recommends products. The outcome was impressive – *according to Octane AI, the quiz increased Jones Road’s average order value from $60 to $90, with a 16%* 19   
*quiz conversion rate* and **50,000+ emails captured in one month** . This underscores the power of interactive funnels: customers who engage with a quiz tend to buy more (higher AOV) and you gain valuable data. For Noor Kids, a quiz funnel can similarly drive a higher-value commitment (annual 

8  
sub \+ upsells, not just a single low-price purchase) and build a rich email list segmented by child age, interests, etc. 

•    
**SpoiledChild (DTC Beauty):** An advanced example of using trials and upsells – SpoiledChild runs a “**$0 trial**” funnel (customer pays nothing upfront for a trial product, just agrees to future subscription) and then stacks multiple upsells in the checkout process. In one case, they even embedded another quiz in an upsell to gather more data and offered an additional trial product as a one-click add-on . Notably, *“with just one click… \[customers\] added another trial subscription (and*   
14 

14   
*potential re-bill) to \[the\] purchase”* . This creative funnel within a funnel shows how far one can go. For Noor Kids, we don’t need that complexity, but it validates our approach of a **low-cost trial leading to recurring billing and using one-click upsells to increase LTV**. SpoiledChild’s funnel reportedly drives millions of visits and has mastered the “try before you buy” model –   
20 14 

inspiration that a well-oiled funnel can scale massively. 

•    
**Other DTC Quiz Examples:** Many other brands use quizzes to customize subscriptions or product bundles – from vitamins (e.g., Care/of) to meal kits. These typically ask a series of personal questions and then give a tailored recommendation. The key learning from across the board is that **quiz funnels convert better by making the customer feel the product is made for them**. They also act as excellent lead magnets (even if someone doesn’t buy immediately, you have their data to nurture). We are leveraging the same idea for Noor Kids, with the twist of focusing on a parent’s goals for their child – a very emotionally charged context which, if anything, should make the funnel even more effective at conversion. 

By studying and borrowing tactics from these examples – personalized recommendations, integrated upsells, capturing zero-party data – we ensure our funnel design is grounded in what’s **working currently in e-commerce**. In fact, personalization via quizzes is now considered a must-have by many marketers, as it’s one of the best ways to collect **zero-party data** (information customers willingly share) to improve 21   
marketing outcomes . Noor Kids can ride this trend, engaging parents in a fun Q\&A, and in return, delivering a solution that feels custom-fit to their parenting needs. 

**Implementation with Shopify Tools & Apps** 

Finally, turning this plan into reality on a Shopify store will likely involve a combination of apps and custom setup. Here are recommendations for each part of the funnel: 

**Quiz / Survey Builder:** Use a Shopify-compatible **quiz funnel app** to create the multi-step   
•  

questionnaire. Leading options include **Octane AI**, **Jebbit**, **Prehook**, or **Quizify**, among others. For instance, **Octane AI** is a popular choice for building personalized product recommendation quizzes 22   
and has *“seamless integration with email marketing tools”* (like Klaviyo) . It allows conditional logic (so we can branch or dynamically change text based on answers), and can directly embed the quiz on a Shopify page. These apps usually provide templates for quiz design and support for capturing emails, which fits our needs (we can design the questions, the conditional result text, and even which product to recommend at the end – i.e., the 99¢ trial product). Alternative: a form builder like Typeform embedded in a Shopify page could work, but dedicated Shopify quiz apps are preferable for integration (they can add products to cart based on answers, sync data to customer profiles, etc.). Octane AI, for example, could automatically recommend the “99¢ Trial” product at the end based on the quiz (essentially every outcome leads to that product, possibly with slight messaging variations). 

9  
It also collects the quiz responses as **zero-party data** attached to the customer, which Noor Kids could later use (e.g., tag a customer as “interested in Honesty & Kindness” for personalized emails).  

•    
**Landing Page Setup:** The funnel pages (especially the intro and program info pages) might be built   
using a landing page or content builder app (like **Shogun, GemPages, or Shopify’s native page sections**) to have full control over layout and branding. However, many quiz apps let you design the whole flow inside them (with your brand colors, images, etc.) and then you just link to the quiz start page. We could, for example, have a landing page at noorkids.com/start with a “Begin Quiz” button (and some persuasive copy as in Step 1), which on click launches the first quiz question (this could be an embedded element or a pop-up). Choose the method that provides the smoothest UX. The key is to host it on Noor Kids’ domain for trust (no redirecting to an external survey site if possible). 

•    
**Progress Bar & UX Components:** If using a quiz app like Octane or Jebbit, check that it supports 

showing a progress bar or step count (most do, and often you can toggle it on). Ensure it’s enabled and styled nicely. Also configure the quiz UI: e.g., using image choice buttons for questions (these apps support images for answer choices), adding small captions or icons as described. One can likely implement our desired design without coding – these tools are made for marketers to create interactive flows visually. 

•    
**Personalized Text and Logic:** The quiz app should allow us to set up outcome pages or personalized   
messaging. We’ll set up one primary outcome which is essentially “the Noor Kids program is recommended for everyone,” but we personalize the text using quiz responses. E.g., in Octane AI, you can pipe answers into the result page (“You mentioned \[Challenge\] and \[Value\]”). If deeper logic is needed (like slightly different blurb if the child is a teenager vs younger), we can configure multiple result variations (maybe a result for ages 6–9 vs 10–14 to tweak tone). But to start, a single dynamic results page is fine. This doesn’t require coding, just careful setup in the app’s logic builder. The result page in the quiz will effectively be our **Step 4 (insights) \+ Step 5 (program intro)** combined or consecutive. We might actually split it: some quiz builders allow a multi-step result: first part is “assessment” (insights), then you click next to “recommendation” (the product). If not, we can combine them on one page with a section that provides insights and then a section that pitches the program and trial. 

•    
**Adding the Trial to Cart:** The critical part – when the user clicks the CTA to start trial, how to handle the subscription sign-up. Noor Kids likely uses a subscription app to handle the recurring billing (commonly **Recharge, Bold Subscriptions, Appstle,** or Shopify’s native Subscription APIs via an app like **Shopify Payments \+ Subscription**). We must ensure this app supports a $0.99 first payment and $89.99 annual renewals – which it should (Recharge, for example, allows a trial or initial fee configuration). We’ll need to create a **subscription product** in Shopify (or via the app) for “Noor Kids Annual Plan – Trial Offer” with those billing terms. The quiz’s final CTA button should add that product to the cart and ideally go to checkout. Many quiz apps can be configured to redirect to a specific product or cart URL. If not, we can put a direct link or use some custom code: e.g., a link to   
/cart/add?productid=12345\&quantity=1 that adds the trial product and goes to cart/ checkout.  

Given that subscriptions sometimes require using the app’s checkout flow (for example, Recharge can either use Shopify Checkout or its own, depending on setup), we should integrate accordingly. Shopify nowadays 

10  
(2025) supports native subscription through apps, so the checkout is likely normal Shopify checkout with an on-site subscription widget (for terms agreement). We saw on the 99¢ product page a note about it being a 23   
recurring purchase , meaning an app is managing it likely in Shopify’s checkout. So, reusing that setup, our funnel just needs to point the user to that same product. 

•    
**Upsell Implementation:** Shopify has built-in support for **post-purchase upsell offers** via its Checkout Extensions. Apps like **Zipify OneClickUpsell, AfterSell, ReConvert** etc., plug into this. To implement Upsell 1 and 2: 

•    
Create a product for the *Book Bundle* (one-time product, could be hidden from normal store if you like) and a subscription product for *Treehouse Trial* (e.g., $0 for first month, auto $X thereafter monthly – configured in the subscription app). 

•    
Use an upsell app to set up a **post-purchase funnel**: After the customer completes the trial 

purchase, they see Upsell 1 offer. If they accept, it adds the book bundle to their order (charges their card immediately for that amount). Then you can show a second offer (Upsell 2). If they accept Treehouse, since it’s a subscription, ideally it adds that as a new subscription to their order (the app might need to create a second transaction for $0 or just a record – this part is a bit more complex because it’s a subscription; however, as SpoiledChild’s example shows, it’s doable to add a 14   
subscription in a post-purchase upsell , likely via integration between the upsell app and the subscription app). Apps like ReCharge or Skio sometimes have one-click cross-sell features as well. •    
If the upsell app doesn’t handle subscription add-ons gracefully in post-purchase, an alternative is to offer Treehouse as an *opt-in checkbox on the initial checkout page*. Shopify’s latest checkout extensibility might allow adding a checkbox like “✓ Add free month of Treehouse (renews at $X)” which when checked adds the subscription before payment. This is another route using Shopify Scripts or custom checkout extension. It’s a bit technical but possible. However, the simplest approach might be to treat Treehouse trial as a $0 item and use post-purchase; since it’s free, charging is not an issue at that moment, and the subscription app can trigger the renewal later. 

In summary, using a tool like **ReConvert Post Purchase** or **AfterSell**, you can design nice upsell pages with our copy/images, and set the trigger conditions (e.g., show Upsell 1 when product \= trial, then Upsell 2). 15   
These apps brag about increasing AOV significantly and are Shopify-approved, so they won’t jeopardize the checkout process. Implementation might require coordinating with the subscription app’s settings to ensure a seamless experience. 

•    
**Analytics & Tracking:** We should instrument this funnel to track drop-off at each step. Quiz apps often show you completion rates. Use that data to tweak copy if many drop at a certain question. Also track how many proceed to checkout, and of those, how many accept each upsell. This will inform optimizations (for instance, if Upsell 2 uptake is very low, maybe the offer needs to be messaged differently or offered later via email). 

•    
**Email & SMS follow-up:** Integrate with **Klaviyo or Omnisend** for email marketing. When the quiz 

app collects the email (either mid-quiz or at checkout when they purchase), tag that profile with the quiz responses (most quiz apps do this or we can use hidden fields). Then set up automated flows: if someone started the quiz but didn’t finish or didn’t purchase, send a friendly follow-up with perhaps a snippet of their “insights” and a link to resume. If they did purchase, follow up with a welcome email reiterating the values they chose and how excited we are to start the journey (personal touch\!). Also, for those who took the Treehouse trial, an onboarding email for that product. The data from 

11  
the funnel can also personalize future content (e.g., weekly tips related to the values they chose, etc., which increases engagement and retention). 

Implementing all of the above does require some configuration, but **no heavy custom coding** – mostly using existing Shopify apps in tandem: 

•    
*Quiz:* Octane AI or Jebbit (both have Shopify App Store listings and case studies of success).  •    
*Subscription:* Recharge or Appstle (to handle the trial subscription product and Treehouse sub). Ensure the app supports initial discounted trial – Recharge does (e.g., “$0.99 first charge, next charge in 1 month for $89.99”).  

•    
*Upsells:* Zipify OneClickUpsell or AfterSell (to implement the post-checkout upsell funnel). These are plug-and-play; we’ll design the offer pages with our copy/images in their editor.  

•    
*Page Design:* If needed, a page builder for the non-quiz content or use the quiz app’s landing page feature.  

•    
*Testing:* Use Shopify’s preview and test mode for checkout to simulate the full flow (especially to 

verify that the subscription transitions and upsells work correctly).  

•    
*Optimization:* Over time, consider adding a tool like Google Optimize (if still available) or built-in A/B testing in the quiz app to experiment with variations. 

By leveraging these tools, Noor Kids can deploy this funnel without building a custom web app from scratch – it’s all Shopify-friendly. The key is ensuring all pieces (quiz, subscription, upsell) integrate smoothly. Fortunately, the ecosystem is mature: **Shopify Plus merchants routinely use quiz funnels and one-click** 22 15   
**upsells** to great effect, so there’s a clear path to do this . 

**In conclusion**, this multi-page onboarding funnel will act as a guided journey that takes a parent from a casual site visitor to an emotionally-invested subscriber. By asking about their child, reflecting their concerns, and tying the solution directly to those needs, we create a powerful *personal connection* – the parent isn’t just buying *books*, they’re investing in their child’s character and faith. The $0.99 trial lowers the barrier enough for them to say “why not,” and once they’re in the system, the high-quality content will speak for itself, leading to a full annual subscription (and with upsells, access to even more Noor Kids resources).  

This approach is designed to **maximize conversion rates** (through personalization, social proof, and removal of friction) and **maximize revenue** (through strategic upsells and cross-sells), all while genuinely helping customers get what they want – a child who embodies the values they cherish. By using the outlined pages, emotional triggers, and Shopify tools, Noor Kids can significantly boost its subscription sign-ups and achieve a higher lifetime value per customer, all in a way that feels natural and engaging for the parent.
